# Important VS Code Resources

> _These resources and tweaks are from former students.  Settings, extensions, and tweaks are user dependant and personal.  Find what you like!_

We will be using Visual Studio Code as our IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It is available for Mac, PC, and Linux systems.

> **Important**\
> There is a _Visual Studio_ and a _Visual Studio Code_! Make sure to have _Visual Studio Code_!

## User Interface

So I am not going to reinvent this wheel. Go read the VS Code User Interface Docs. Learn this UI. It is your new home.

## Setup

After installing VS Code, it is ready to go. However, here are a few things to help with optimize the workflow, organization, and experience.

### Command Line Launch

#### Mac Only (Windows & Linux ready out of box(mostly!))
It is handy to launch VS Code directly from the CLI (Command Line Interface) or Terminal app. Here is what to do.

1. Launch VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P)
3. Type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-shell-command.png)

4. Restart your Terminal App.

Now you can type "code . " or "code . (file name)" in any folder to start editing in VS Code!

### Sign-in and Sync

VS Code now has a Sync feature built in that will sync all your customizations and extensions across devices and will restore if you ever have a system failure or change. Also, if you login with GitHub, you can access and use Git directly in VS Code and use key extensions, like GitHub and LiveShare.

> **Important**\
> You need a GitHub account! It is your life now. Use it!

1. Click on the Avatar icon.\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-Avatar.png)
2. Click on "Sign in to Sync Settings"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-Sync.png)
3. A window will open at the top. Click on "Sign in and Turn on"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-SyncSettings.png)
4. Now another window will open, click on "Sign in with GitHub"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-GitHub-Signin.png)
5. Now a browser will open(I know, crazy, but stay with me), click on "Continue"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-GitHub-Browser-Auth.png)
6. Now an alert will open, click on "Open Visual Studio Code"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-GitHub-Auth-Confirm1.png) - If there is no alert or it doesn't work, use the "Didn't work" option at the bottom of the browser.\
    ![](../md-img/VSCode-GitHub-Auth-notWork.png)
7. Back to VSCode, a security window will open(OMG, Really! Thanks Black Hats!), click on "Open"\
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-GitHub-Auth-Confirm2.png)
8. Finally, it is connected! Celebrate!\

## Settings

![](../md-img/VSCode-Gear.png)

Under the Gear icon is an important menu with several quick access items. But lets go to "Settings".

For the most part, you can leave everything at it's default settings. But from here, you can tweak VS Code. The common tweaks are listed first.

> Note: these are optional tweaks and based on personal preference.

1. Auto Save\
   You can set VS Code to auto save your work. This can be useful for live previewing and to never forget to save!
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-autoSave.png)
   You have three options:

   - afterDelay _(most common)_
     - saves your file after a set time (in ms so 1 sec is 1000. Get used to it, that is programming!)\
       Set the time in the field below the select field.\
       ![](../md-img/VSCode-autoSave-delay.png)
   - onFocusChange
     - saves file when you move away from the tab/file you are in to something else in VS Code.
   - onWindowChange
     - saves file when you change to a different system window, like Finder.

2. Font and Size\
   We will talk more about this in Theme's in Extensions, but you can change the font size and Font type here if you like.
   ![](../md-img/VSCode-Font.png)

3. Tab Indention: 2 vs 4\
   Ok, this is a war that has been ragging in programming since the beginning of time, like Jedi vs Sith. (just do a Google search)
   ![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/tMiHhTLvQcavm/giphy.gif?cid=5a38a5a2xaa9hfeqrcmdvggequvvljukhkynbhejkjms9g95&rid=giphy.gif)

It is a personal preference....kinda. Python requires a 4 space tab. Lots of React & Gatsby projects use a 2 space tab, but it's not required. So, this option is here if/when you want/need to change it.\
![](../md-img/VSCode-tab-size.png)

At this point, you can dive deeper into the tweaks. Experiment if you like. Just remember what you did so you can undo it.

## Extensions

![](../md-img/VSCode-Extensions.png)

Extensions are plugins. And there are a plethora.

Here are a few that are common place and are handy. Again, most are optional, but some you will want for class.

Feel free to share what you find as we are always looking for useful extensions.

## How to install

Click on the extensions icon in VS Code and search for the Extension you want.

Or

Click on the link and install from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
